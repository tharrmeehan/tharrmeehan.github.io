Hello, I’m an Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning Student @ Lucerne Applied University of
Sciences and Arts. I’m interested in anything AI/ML related, especially Natural Language Processing and
Computer Vision. 

I’m always looking for new projects or challenges to work on and I’m very motivated to learn new skills or
anything state-of-the-art in the field. Currently, I'm having a lot of fun with PyTorch and TensorFlow.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or just want to chat. I’m always happy to help
